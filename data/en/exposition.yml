The cost will be $900 for a booth, which includes meeting registrations for two people.  A reduced price of $400 applies to academic exhibitors, but only one meeting registration is included. Expo locations will be assigned on a “first paid, first choice” basis.  If you want a prime location for your table, submit your payment as soon as possible.
